# CMPG-323-Overview-33572798
This is my main repository for all my CMPG323 project.
Each project will have its own repository but they will all have acces to this repositiry. This repository is a shared repository.

## Branching Strategies
My branching strategy for all my CMPG 323 projects is Trunk based development. Trunk based development is a strategy whereby the developer(s) merge changes directly to the main branch(trunk).By changes I am refering to small frequet updates. This practice promotes continuous development.

See below the diagram representation of the approach.


## Project and Repository Structure
Every project(Project 1-5) in this module  will have its repository but they will be sharing 1 kanban project.
