## Branching Strategies
I will use trunk-based development as my branching strategy for my projects.
trunk-based development is a branching strategy that will allow me to make changes directly to my main brach.
This is how it works, everytime I want to make changes I will create a temporary branch, make my changes on it, then test if the
changes I made do not affect my program in a bad way or do not have bugs. If there are no bugs I then marge my changes to the main brach.
The changes I will be making will not be very major, and as a result it will be very simple to catch bugs. This strategy promotes continuous integration.
